\item[Julia] Ah, this sucks!
\item[Dylan] What's up?
\item[Julia] I'm supposed to find the slope of a parabola at a point, and I'm not sure how!
\item[Dylan] Well if we had two points we could make a secant line to approximate it!
\item[Julia] Secant line? What's that?
\item[Dylan] A \textit{secant line} is just a line which connects two points on a function!
\item[Julia] But isn't the \textit{tangent} line one that skims a curve at one point? So the slope of the tangent line is the slope at that point! See?
\[
\graph{f(x)=x^2,g(x)=2(x-1)+1}
\]
\item[Dylan] Well do you know how to find the equation for a line with just one point?
\item[Julia]...
\item[James] Come on guys we can approximate the tangent line using the secant line!
\item[Altogether]Let's dive in!
\end{dialogue}



\section{Guided Example}

Consider the function $f(x) = x^2$. In green is $g(x)=4x-4$ the tangent line at the point $x=2$. Thus the slope of the tangent line at $x=2$ is 4.
\[
\graph{f(x)=x^2,g(x)=4x-4}
\]

\begin{question}
Find the slope of the secant line between $x = 2$ and $x = 7$.


$\answer{9}$

Does this seem to be a good approximation for the slope of the tangent line at $x = 2$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Yes}
\choice[correct]{No}
\end{multipleChoice}

Dylan thinks we can solve the problem by just picking something closer than 7. Find the slope of the secant line between $x = 2$ and $x = 3$.

$\answer{5}$

Is this a good approximation for the slope of the tangent line at $x=2$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Yes}
\choice[correct]{No}
\end{multipleChoice}

Is it better than the last attempt?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{Yes}
\choice{No}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}
\begin{dialogue}
\item[Julia] Dylan, this still isn't a great approximation...
\item[Dylan] Well, I think we need to get even closer. Like, infinitesimally close! But how would we do that....
\item[James] You guys need some help?
\item[Julia and Dylan] James! How do we find the slope of a line at a point?
\item[James] It isn't too tough! Before, you were considering a certain point as your comparison. What if instead, you used the point you want to evaluate at plus something really small? Let's call it $h$.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{question}
How can you make the $h$ in $$\frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{(2+h)-2}$$ approach 0?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{Use $\lim_{h \to 0}$.}
\choice{Use $\lim_{h \to \infty}$.}
\choice{Divide the fraction by $h$.}
\choice{Pick a function $f(x)$ so that $f(2)$ is 0.}
\end{multipleChoice}

Using the method you determined, approximate the slope of the tangent line at the point x=2.

$\answer{4}$

\end{question}
\begin{dialogue}
\item[James] Want to know something really cool?
\item[Julia and Dylan] What James?
\item[James] The function we just discovered is how you determine a function's derivative! Using that process, you can find the instantaneous rate of change at any point on a function!
\item[Julia and Dylan] Wow! So cool!
\end{dialogue}

\section{On Your Own}
Using what you've learned, find the derivative of the following functions at the given point.
\setcounter{problem}{0}
\begin{question}
\begin{hint}
Remember you can enter $\sqrt{x}$ as either \begin{verbatim}sqrt(...) or (...)^(1/2)\end{verbatim}
\end{hint}
$g(x) = x^2+1$, $x=2$

$\answer{4}$

$h(x) = \frac{1}{x}$, $x=2$

$\answer{-0.25}$

$f(x)=3x^2+4x+2$, $x=-1$

$\answer{-2}$

$f(x)=\sqrt{x^2+1}$, $x=3$

$\answer{\frac{3}{\sqrt{10}}}$

$f(x) = x+x^{-1}$,$x=4$

$\answer{15/16}$

\end{question}

By replacing the point in our formula for the derivative with $x$, we may determine the derivative at any point on the function. Determine the derivative for the following functions.
\begin{question}
$m(x) = x^3$

$\answer{3x^2}$

$n(x) = 3x+2$

$\answer{3}$

$f(x)=4-x^2$

$\answer{-2x}$

$f(x) = 12+7x$

$\answer{7}$

$f(x)=\frac{4}{x+1}$

$\answer{\frac{-4}{(x+1)^2}}$

\end{question}


\section{In Summary}
\begin{dialogue}
\item[Julia] So why is it called a secant line?
\item[James] It comes from the Latin word secare, which means 'to cut'.
\item[Dylan] Ohh, I get it now! Because a secant line is a line that 'cuts' a function!
\end{dialogue}
In this lab we've (hopefully) learned the function for finding a derivative using the limit as $h$ approaches 0. We also learned what secant and tangent lines are. For your convenience, the important definitions are listed below.
\begin{definition}
 A \textbf{secant line} is any line that connects any two points on a curve.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
A \textbf{tangent line} is a line which intersects a differentiable curve at a point where the slope of the curve equals the slope of the line.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{derivative} of $f(x)$ at $a$ is defined by the following limit:
  \[
  \eval{\frac{d}{dx} f(x)}_{x=a} = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}.
  \]
\end{definition}
