\section{Introduction}
\begin{dialogue}
\item[James] Hey guys, I slept through class yesterday... could you fill me in on what a rational function is?
\item[Julia] See, class didn't make a lot of sense to me because I was thinking, ``Functions can be rational?''
\item[Dylan] They don't mean rational like me or you, Julia! It means \textit{the function can be represented as a fraction where the numerator and denominator are both polynomials}.
\item[Julia and James] Oh!
\item[Dylan] Rational functions are pretty neat, because they can have two different types of discontinuities!
\item[Altogether] LET'S DIVE IN!
\end{dialogue}
\section{Guided Example}
Consider the function $f(x)=\dfrac{(x-2)(x+4)}{(x-3)(x+3)(x+4)}$
\begin{image}
\includegraphics{discontinuityGraph}
\end{image}

\begin{question}
Describe the graph. What strange things do you notice?
\begin{freeResponse}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{question}
The ``hole'' present in the graph is called a \textbf{removable discontinuity}.

The vertical lines that the curve approaches at $x=3$ and $x=-3$ is called a \textbf{vertical asymptote}, another type of discontinuity.

\section{On Your Own}

Find and report the locations of discontinuities in the following functions, note that at this time Desmos does not show removable discontinuities. You will need to find those by hand:

\begin{question}
$a(x) = \dfrac{x^2+1}{x-2}$
\[
\graph{}
\]
\begin{selectAll}
\choice[correct]{$x=2$}
\choice{$x=-1$}
\choice{$x=1$}
\choice{$x=0$}
\choice{$x=4$}
\choice{None}
\end{selectAll}

$b(x) = \dfrac{x^2-5x+7}{x^2-x-6}$
\[
\graph{}
\]

\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$x=2$}
\choice[correct]{$x=-2$}
\choice{$x=1$}
\choice{$x=0$}
\choice[correct]{$x=3$}
\choice{None}
\end{selectAll}

$c(x) = \dfrac{x^2-x}{x}$

\[
\graph{}
\]

\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$x=2$}
\choice{$x=5$}
\choice{$x=1$}
\choice[correct]{$x=0$}
\choice{$x=3$}
\choice{None}
\end{selectAll}

$d(x) = \dfrac{x+2}{x^2-x-6}$

\[
\graph{}
\]

\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$x=-6$}
\choice[correct]{$x=3$}
\choice{$x=2$}
\choice{$x=0$}
\choice[correct]{$x=-2$}
\choice{None}
\end{selectAll}

$f(x) = \dfrac{2x^2+5}{x^2-25}$

\[
\graph{}
\]

\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$x=-1$}
\choice[correct]{$x=-5$}
\choice{$x=10$}
\choice{$x=0$}
\choice[correct]{$x=5$}
\choice{None}
\end{selectAll}

$g(x) = \dfrac{x^3-x^2-15x-9}{x+3}$

\[
\graph{}
\]

\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$x=12$}
\choice{$x=-4$}
\choice{$x=3$}
\choice{$x=5$}
\choice{$x=-3$}
\choice[correct]{None}
\end{selectAll}

$h(x) = \dfrac{1}{3x^2-x}$

\[
\graph{}
\]

\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$x=-\sqrt{3}$}
\choice[correct]{$x=\frac{1}{3}$}
\choice{$x=3$}
\choice[correct]{$x=0$}
\choice{$x=-3$}
\choice{None}
\end{selectAll}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
How can you tell if a rational function has a vertical asymptote or a removable discontinuity?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{Vertical asymptotes occur where only the denominator approaches zero, and removable discontinuities

occur where both the numerator and denominator approach zero.}
\choice{Vertical asymptotes occur where only the numerator approaches zero, and removable discontinuities

occur where both the numerator and denominator approach zero.}
\choice{Vertical asymptotes occur where both the numerator and denominator approach zero, and removable

discontinuities occur where only the denominator approaches zero.}
\choice{Vertical asymptotes occur where only the numerator approaches zero, and removable

discontinuities occur where only the denominator approaches zero.}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}

\section{In Summary}
\begin{dialogue}
\item[James] These functions are pretty neat! What were they called again?
\item[Dylan] They're called \textbf{rational functions}, \textit{fractions where the numerator and denominator are both polynomials}!
\item[Julia] So, when exactly does a \textbf{vertical asymptote} occur?
\item[James] I know this one! \textbf{Vertical asymptotes} \textit{occur at points where the denominator of the function will be zero, but the numerator is non-zero}!
\item[Julia] That makes sense! But when do removable discontinuities occur then?
\item[Dylan] \textbf{Removable discontinuities} \textit{occur where the numerator and denominator are both zero}.
